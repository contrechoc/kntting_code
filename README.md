kntting_code
============
The first undocumented version of an Arduino Script and a Processing script I use 
for making my Brother KH-940 knit my datavisualisations in different knitting techniques.

Be careful: the communications are probably device dependent, the knitic code didn't work for my machines. 
That's why i wrote my own. This software could just not work on yours because of the same reason!

The connections/board are in principle the http://www.knitic.com/ board (but for one PIN):

for needle PIN's:
digital: 3,4,5

Solenoids array:
digital: 22,24,26,28,30,32,34,36,37,35,33,31,29,27,25,23

right/left solenoid sensors:
analog 0,1
